# Library Management System

A mock replication of a University Library Managment Sysyem. Different versions of the system are created, each using different data structures to store the records.  

## Functions

The following library management system replicates some of the basic functionalities of the library such as checking for the availibility of books, issueing of books, adding and deleting records in the system and calculation of pending fines.

## Use of Data Structures

The follwoing management system requires multiple data structures. Seperate data structures are required for maintaining book records and member records. All the records are initialised at the start of the program. Following the initialisation, these records can be modified with addition or deletion of entries. All records are sorted based on a pre-decieded key. 

## Types of Data Structures used

The repository consists of 3 versions of the management system. The following data structures are used for the system:

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Trees (B Trees)
